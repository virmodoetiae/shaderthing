TO-CONSIDER --------------------------------------------------------------------

*   Enable option to use the quantizer palette for GIF quantization on GIF 
    exporting

*   Record video tutorial(s) of application usage, host them on YouTube, 
    possibly find a way to add tutorial links within the application.

*   Re-work the save system to leverage a more structure storage format, e.g.,
    JSON-like files
